### completion

The key shortcuts inside the completion menu are:

<C-n> / <C-p> — navigate down/up through suggestions
<CR> — confirm and insert the selected entry
<C-e> — close the menu and go back to what you typed
<C-y> — confirm without inserting a newline (alternative to Enter)

If the menu doesn't appear automatically you can always trigger it manually with <C-x><C-o>.
